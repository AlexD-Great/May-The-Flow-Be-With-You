About Me
Hi! I'm Altcoin Daddy, i am a web3 developer passionate about creating engaging decentralized applications. I believe in building intuitive and fun experiences on blockchain that showcase the unique capabilities of decentralized systems.

Team
This project was developed as a solo effort by:

Motivation
I created Random Word Chain Game to demonstrate how on-chain randomness can create fair and engaging gameplay experiences. Traditional word games often rely on centralized randomness that players must trust, but can never verify. By leveraging Flow's built-in randomness beacon, this game provides:

Provable fairness - Every letter distribution is transparently derived from blockchain randomness
Educational value - The game showcases how randomness can be implemented in a practical application
Accessibility - Word games are universally understood, making this an approachable introduction to blockchain gaming

I wanted to contribute to the Flow ecosystem with a project that's both technically interesting and genuinely fun to play, showing that blockchain games can go beyond collectibles to create novel gameplay experiences.

Project Overview
Random Word Chain is a blockchain-based word game that leverages Flow's on-chain randomness to create an engaging and provably fair word-building experience. Players receive randomly generated letters and form words to earn points, with longer words yielding higher scores. Each time a word is submitted, the used letters are replaced with new random ones, creating an ever-evolving challenge.

Randomness Implementation
This game utilizes Flow's built-in randomness beacon to generate truly unpredictable letters for players. When letters are requested, the contract calls Flow's randomness service and transforms the resulting values into letters of the alphabet. This ensures that letter distribution is fair and cannot be predicted or manipulated, creating a level playing field for all participants.
Key randomness implementations:

Random letter generation using Flow's RandomBeacon contract
Unpredictable letter distribution based on random values
Fair replenishment of letters after word submission

How to Run
Prerequisites

Flow CLI installed
Flow account with testnet access

Deployment Steps
bash# Deploy the contract to your Flow account
flow project deploy --network=testnet

# Register as a player
flow transactions send ./src/transactions/setup_account.cdc

# Get your initial letters
flow scripts execute ./src/scripts/get_letters.cdc <your-address>

# Submit a word
flow transactions send ./src/transactions/submit_word.cdc "yourword"
Game Rules

Each player starts with 7 random letters
Players must form valid words using only the letters they have
After submitting a word, the used letters are replaced with new random ones
Points are awarded based on word length and complexity
Players can request new letters if they're stuck (with a small score penalty)

Technologies

Flow Blockchain
Cadence Smart Contracts
Flow's RandomBeacon for on-chain randomness
JavaScript (for frontend interaction)

Design Decisions
Why On-Chain Randomness?
Traditional word games often use predetermined patterns or server-side randomness that cannot be verified. By using Flow's on-chain randomness, our game provides:

Provable fairness in letter distribution
Transparent game mechanics
Resistance to manipulation
Decentralized gameplay experience

Game Mechanics
The game uses a simplified scoring system where each letter contributes points based on its rarity in English. This creates strategic decisions for players:

Save rare letters for longer words?
Use common letters quickly to cycle through more options?
Hold letters in hope of forming bonus-point combinations?

Smart Contract Structure
The contract is designed with modularity in mind:

Core game logic separated from randomness functions
Player data stored efficiently on-chain
Optimized for minimal gas costs during play

Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Ensuring Fair Letter Distribution
Solution: Instead of using simple modulo operations that might bias toward certain letters, we implemented a weighted distribution system that mimics the frequency of letters in the English language.
Challenge: Validating Words Efficiently
Solution: To keep gas costs low while verifying if words are valid, we implemented a compressed trie data structure for the dictionary that balances storage costs with lookup efficiency.
Challenge: Managing Gas Costs
Solution: Optimized the contract to batch operations and minimize storage operations, making the game affordable to play even for users new to blockchain.
AI Prompts Used
These prompts were used to assist in development:

"How can I implement secure randomness in Flow's Cadence language?"
"What's the most gas-efficient way to store a dictionary of words in Cadence?"
"How to create a weighted distribution of letters based on English language frequency?"
"Optimizing storage patterns for game state in Flow blockchain"

Future Improvements

Multiplayer mode where players compete with the same set of random letters
Time-based challenges with special rewards
Integration with Flow NFTs to unlock special letter powers
Weekly tournaments with FLOW token prizes
Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go play
