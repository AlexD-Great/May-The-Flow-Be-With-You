This repository documents my progress in the **May the Flow Be With You** coding challenge (May 2025). Each week’s folder will include a unique project submission exploring Flow blockchain concepts using Cadence and front-end tools.

## 📅 Week 1 — WheelOfFortune🎲

**Theme:** The Randomness Revolution

For Week 1, I created an interactive smart contract that simulates a **spin-the-wheel game** with weighted reward segments. Users connect their wallet through the React frontend and trigger a Flow transaction that emits a spin result based on a deterministic pseudo-random number (derived from block timestamps).

- ✅ Smart contract deployed to Flow Testnet: `0xb3905e10b1e5c542`
- ✅ Frontend built in React with animated wheel and FCL wallet integration
- ❌ No token transfers yet — rewards are virtual labels (e.g., "100 FLOW", "Try Again")

🧠 **Key learning from Week 1:**
Building a deterministic reward system on-chain without access to true randomness, and handling FCL transaction logic on the frontend.

## 📅 Week 2 — ToTheMOONNNN 🎮

**Theme:** Actually Fun Games

For Week 2, I built **Click-to-Moon**, a meme-infused clicker game where players generate *thrust points* by clicking a rocket. Players can upgrade their boosters, automate thrust generation, and race to reach the Moon.

- ✅ Frontend built in React with animated rocket and real-time thrust counter
- ✅ Players can upgrade boosters to increase thrust per click
- Planning to include a feature such that players progress are saved on-chain

🧠 **Key learning from Week 2:**  
Balancing state management with fun gameplay mechanics and creating a gameplay loop that is simple but addictive.
