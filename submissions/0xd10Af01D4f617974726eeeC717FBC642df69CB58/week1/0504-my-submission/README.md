# Randomness Revolution - Initial Submission

## Date: May 4, 2023

## Overview
This is the initial submission for Week 1 of the Flow hackathon, focused on the Randomness Revolution theme. Today's work introduces the foundation of a project that leverages Flow's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) beacon using the CadenceArch framework on Flow EVM.

## Prompts Used
1. "How to implement secure randomness using Flow's VRF beacon on Flow EVM"
2. "Flow VRF beacon implementation examples with CadenceArch"
3. "Best practices for consuming VRF randomness in Solidity contracts on Flow"
4. "How to use CadenceRandomConsumer in Flow EVM smart contracts"

## Implementation Details
The source code in the `src` directory demonstrates how to access and utilize Flow's VRF beacon for secure randomness using the CadenceArch framework. The RandomnessGenerator contract inherits from CadenceRandomConsumer to provide cryptographically secure random numbers for blockchain applications.

## Key Features
- Secure random number generation using Flow's VRF beacon
- Range-based random number requests
- Random item selection from arrays
- Tracking of generated random values per address
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Next Steps
- Create visual demonstrations of the randomness quality
- Implement more complex use cases for VRF (lotteries, games, etc.)
- Add examples of batch randomness requests
- Optimize gas usage for randomness operations
- Explore integration with other Flow EVM features
