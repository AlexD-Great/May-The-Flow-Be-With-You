# May the Flow Be With You - Contest Submission: Random Game

## Project Overview

This repository documents my participation and submissions for the "May the Flow be with You" coding challenge (May 2025).

My initial project focus is on building a simple, verifiable **on-chain random dice roll** mechanism using Flow's native randomness capabilities. This serves as a foundational component for exploring more complex on-chain game mechanics.

## Motivation

I'm participating in this contest primarily to:

1.  **Learn Flow:** Deepen my understanding of the Flow blockchain, Cadence programming language, and the Flow development ecosystem.
2.  **Explore On-Chain Randomness:** Experiment with Flow's secure randomness features, a crucial element for fair and engaging decentralized games and applications.
3.  **Build a Foundation:** Create a core component (the dice roll) that can be expanded upon or integrated into larger projects. My long-term interest lies in potentially integrating this with a front-end game engine like Phaser.js to create interactive on-chain gaming experiences.
4.  **Engage with the Community:** Connect with other developers in the Flow ecosystem and participate in the weekly challenges.

## Team

*   Solo developer: CJ Carnicle - aiSports Founder

## Technology Focus

*   **Blockchain:** Flow
*   **Smart Contract Language:** Cadence
*   **Key Feature:** Flow On-Chain Randomness
*   **Future Interest:** JavaScript, potentially Phaser.js for front-end integration.

## Contest Participation & Structure

This project is developed specifically for the "May the Flow be with You" contest. Submissions will be organized according to the contest structure:

*   **`week1/`**: Projects related to "The Randomness Revolution". My initial dice roll project will be submitted here.
*   **`week2/`**: Projects for Week 2's theme (TBD).
*   **`week3/`**: Projects for Week 3's theme (TBD).
*   **`week4/`**: Projects for Week 4's theme (TBD).

Each individual project submission within the weekly folders will contain its own `README.md` detailing the specific implementation, source code, and any AI prompts used during development, as per the contest rules.

## Future Plans

While the initial focus is the dice roll contract for Week 1, I aim to:

*   Refine the dice roll contract for potential reusability.
*   Use Phaser: https://phaser.io/examples/v3.85.0/games
*   Explore different ways to utilize Flow's randomness.
*   (Stretch Goal) Begin integrating the on-chain logic with a basic front-end interface, potentially using a game engine like Phaser.js later down the line.

## Building in Public

I plan to share my progress throughout the contest on Twitter: @ccarnicle
