            From the roiling heart of the Chaotic Nebula, a nascent world whispers its arrival - <strong>Primordia</strong>. Here, the raw energies of creation collide, birthing landscapes of impossible beauty and terrifying flux. You are a <strong>Genesis Shaper</strong>, an entity touched by the Echoes of the First Forging, imbued with the rare ability to perceive and sculpt the Anima â€“ the very lifeblood of this emergent sphere.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize="xl" maxW="3xl" lineHeight="tall">
            Your purpose is to enact the <strong>Genesis Protocol</strong>: to seed Primordia with life, to nurture fledgling elemental beings from mere motes of Anima into complex creatures of power and purpose. These are not mere beasts, Shaper, but living manifestations of Primordia's volatile will. Their forms shift, their abilities transmute, their destinies intertwine with the fate of this new reality.

          <Text fontSize="xl" maxW="3xl" lineHeight="tall">
            Uncover the ancient secrets veiled within Primordia's elemental strata. Guide your creations through trials of survival and evolution. For in the balance of their growth lies the key to Primordia's stability, and perhaps, to understanding the echoes of your own mysterious origin.
