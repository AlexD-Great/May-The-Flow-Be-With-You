# Lucky Spinning Wheel - Initial Submission

## Date: May 10, 2025

## Overview
This is the initial submission for Week 1 of the Flow Hackathon under the **Randomness Revolution** theme.

**Lucky Spinning Wheel** is a decentralized application (dApp) that combines gaming with trustless randomness. Users spin a wheel whose outcome is determined by secure, verifiable randomness provided by Flow EVM’s VRF. This ensures a fair and tamper-proof experience for every player.

The project is developed by [Tasneem Toolba](https://x.com/tasneemtoolba), using a modern stack that includes a Solidity smart contract on Flow EVM and a frontend built with Next.js.
