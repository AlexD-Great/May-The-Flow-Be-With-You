# Flow Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **"May the Flow be with You"** hackathon, focused on creating innovative, blockchain-powered applications using Flow EVM and smart contracts.

The submission for **Week 1** is **Lucky Spinning Wheel**, a fun and fair game that uses verifiable randomness from Flow EVM’s VRF beacon to power a spinning wheel. Each spin delivers a provably random result, providing a trustworthy user experience.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore and leverage the Flow blockchain's capabilities to create engaging applications that align with the weekly themes of the hackathon:

For Week 1’s **Randomness Revolution** theme, the project demonstrates:
- Integration with Flow VRF for secure randomness
- On-chain randomness consumption in a Solidity contract
- A responsive frontend showing the spinning animation tied to VRF outcomes

The remaining weeks will either expand on this foundation or introduce new ideas aligned with each weekly theme:

- **Week 1 – Randomness Revolution:** ✅ *Lucky Spinning Wheel game using Flow’s VRF beacon*  
- **Week 2 –   
- **Week 3 –   
- **Week 4 –
